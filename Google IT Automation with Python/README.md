**Cheat Sheet**
> Comparison operators a == b: a is equal to b
- a != b: a is different than b
- a < b: a is smaller than b
- a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b
- a > b: a is bigger than b
- a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b

> Logical operators
- a and b: True if both a and b are True. Falseotherwise.
- a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.
- not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.

> Python Assignment Operators
- operator, example same as
- =	,x = 5	,x = 5	
- +=,x += 3	,x = x + 3	


Python Assignment Operators
| Operator | Example | Same as |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| = | x = 5 | x = 5 |
| += | += 3 | x = x+3 |
|*=	|x *= 3	|x = x * 3	
|/=	|x /= 3	|x = x / 3	
|%=	|x %= 3	|x = x % 3	
|//=|	x //= 3	|x = x // 3	
|**=(**mutlak)|	x **= 3	|x = x ** 3	
|&=	|x &= 3	x = |x & 3	
| mutlak= |x = 3	x = |x | 3	
|^=	|x ^= 3	x = |x ^ 3	
|>>=|	x >>= 3	|x = x >> 3	
|<<=|	x <<= 3	|x = x << 3


> Others
- // floor divison
- % modulus
- ** exponentiation

> Elif Keyword used to handle more than two comparison cases
